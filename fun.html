                    <p>This is my family in Indonesia. The last time I saw them was this January.
                        I think this picture was taken in 2018 on our morning walk.

                    <p>These are two out seven of our cats in Indonesia. One day, the momma cat followed me home.
                        My sister and I were persistent on insisting to keep her, so we did. The momma cat gave
                        birth to 4 female kittens and then to 2 male kittens. Finally, we were able to save up 
                        some money to sterilize them.

                    <img src="amrik fam.JPG" alt="American family">
                    <p>This is my American family. They hosted me during my exchange year in 2016-2017.
                        I went home to re-do my senior year in 2017-2018 because my senior exchange year didn't count.
                        Then, I came back to the Twin Cities for college and lived with them for my freshman and sophomore years.
                        Now, I am a Resident Advisor (RA) in Morrison, so I don't live with them anymore. I still come "home" 
                        every week or every other week.

                    <img src="dogs.png" alt="American dogs">
                    <p>These are my American family's dogs. They like to bark to pretty much anything.
                        The beagle mixed one is so obsessed with food. However, they're so cute and cuddly.

                    <img src="guitar.png" alt="playing guitar">
                    <p>I like to play guitar for fun. This picture was taken during Global Tommies Excursion in 2018</p><p></p>

                    <img src="canoe.png" alt="canoeing">
                    <p>In general, I like to be outside. This picture was taken somewhere in the northsore. The snake was just swimming by, and we wanted to say hi.</p><p></p>

                    <p>City biking is fun! Downhill biking is kind of scary.</p>

                    <p>My American mom and I like to bike in the city. Sometimes, we get ice cream afterwards. That would define one of our perfect days!</p><p></p>
