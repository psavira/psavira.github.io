                    <p>The University Innovation Fellows (run through Stanford's world-renowned d.school) 
                        empowers students to become leaders of change in higher education. Fellows are creating
                        a global movement to ensure that all students gain the necessary attitudes, skills and
                        knowledge to compete in the economy of the future. For the past two years, a cohort 
                        of up to four St. Thomas students have undergone training, designed and implemented
                        an innovation on campus, and traveled to the Silicon Valley Meetup to share their 
                        work with other University Innovation Fellows at Google, Microsoft and Stanford 
                        University faculty.

                    <p>Currently, there are five of us, UST students, involved in 2020 UIF Cohort.
                        We are going through a rigorous 6-weeks training. During the training,
                        we have to come up with prototypes to make impactful, prolonged changes 
                        at the University of St. Thomas. We have been using Human-Centered Design and 
                        the Lean Startup framework throughout the process. For example, we have to do
                        interviews with our friends and ask them about their experience from last semester
                        when classes were moved online. One of that statements we've based our solutions on
                        is "I don't feel like a student anymore." From there, we've been interviewing more
                        students, mostly freshman, on our prototype. We will then hold a meeting with our
                        stakeholders, such us President Sullivan and some professors.

                    <p>The 30th annual International Dinner is a spring tradition hosted by the
                    Globally Minded Student Association. The purpose of this event is to celebrate
                    internationalism and diversity at the University of St. Thomas. The event was held 
                    on Saturday, April 27, in the Woulfe Alumni Hall in the third floor of 
                    Anderson Student Center. The dinner was a semiformal event where guests were 
                    encouraged to wear their traditional clothing.

                    <p>The fall semester of my first year, I was a member of the 30th International 
                    Dinner Committee. I compiled the archives of past International Dinners from the 
                    library because I thought it would be fun to be nostalgic for the 30th International
                    Dinner. Forcing myself to get out of my comfort zone and to grow, I also offered 
                    myself to be the emcee. Part way through the semester, the committee leader announced 
                    she would go on a semester-long study abroad program in the spring semester, and 
                    therefore we needed a new leader soon. Having plenty experiences planning events in 
                    Indonesia, I braced myself to take over the leadership role as a first-year student. 
                    With our advisor’s help, I was able to learn how to build relationships with many 
                    stakeholders to best hold this event. With my current connections with international 
                    and domestic students, I was able to reconstruct a solid team of the 30th International 
                    Dinner committee. The 30th International Dinner was a success. The nostalgic feels were 
                    maintained with old pictures displayed both on the screens and tables. We had food 
                    representing most continents. Moreover, only having slots for 20 flag carriers didn’t 
                    stop us from engaging more students; a friend and I made and presented a video with 
                    international and domestic students saying welcome, enjoy, and see you in their 
                    languages throughout the evening. All audiences could be engaged by participating 
                    on a Kahoot! Quiz and an Indonesian traditional dance tutorial. We richly celebrated 
                    internationalism throughout this event.

                    <h1>Youtube Channel during Quarantine</h1>
                    <p>During quarantine, I created tutorial videos and uploaded them on Youtube to 
                    help students in Indonesia who are looking for colleges and scholarships in the 
                    U.S.. One of my videos got over 9,000 views as of early October 2020. The project
                    started because I wanted to help provide some insights on studying abroad with my 
                    spare time during quarantine. Getting featured by Voice of America (VOA) in Indonesia
                    was also one of the reasons I started this project.
